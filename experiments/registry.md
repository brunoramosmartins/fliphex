# Experiment Registry

Every experiment is registered **before it runs**. Results are appended after.
An experiment that is not in this table did not happen.

Freely editable (append-only in practice).

## Format

- **ID** — `EXP-NNN`, allocated in order, never reused.
- **Hypothesis** — H1–H6, or `—` for exploratory runs.
- **Status** — `registered` → `running` → `complete` / `abandoned`.
- **Seed** — the RNG seed. Required. `—` only for deterministic exhaustive solves.
- **Result** — one line, with a CI or an exact value. Links to the notebook or figure.

**Registration basis.** EXP-001 through EXP-005 are registered against the H1/H2
text at tag `v0.3-hypotheses`. Any post-lock amendment to that text is recorded
in `docs/research.md` with its reason before it can affect a verdict here.

### EXP-001 — 3×3 exhaustive solve, both arms

- **Objective.** The exact game value of the 3×3 variant and one optimal
  principal variation, **and** the adr-010 V3 artefact: the same variant solved
  twice, by forward alpha-beta and by retrograde sweep, with values agreeing on
  every position. This is the solver's **correctness fixture**, not a strategy
  result — 9 cells is too cramped for the tactics the 5×5 design is about.
- **Hypothesis.** H1, H2.
- **Configuration.** 9 cells, odd. Per
  [adr-011](../docs/adr/adr-011-reduced-variant-parity.md), `a = 4`:
  - **H1 arm** — P1: `{P6, P3-y, P1, P2-adj}` + joker (5 tiles). P2: the same
    four archetypes (4 tiles).
  - **H2 arm** — P1: `{P6, P3-y, P1, P2-adj, P2-skip}` (5 archetypes, no joker).
    P2: `{P6, P3-y, P1, P2-adj}`.

  Both arms: hands exactly exhausted at ply 9, P1 moves last, bound
  **7.12 × 10⁵**, terminal layer **512** (`--cells 9 --hands 5 4`). Identical
  state-space size, so the arms are matched. Deterministic and exhaustive: no
  seed.
- **Decision rule.** 9 is odd, so draws are impossible and the value is exactly
  one of `P1 wins` / `P2 wins`. The run counts as evidence only if it terminates
  by exhaustion (adr-004 R1, `termination: exhausted`); a depth- or time-capped
  run produces no verdict. Gates: adr-010 **V0, V1, V2, V3, V5**. V3 is
  mandatory here — it is why this experiment exists.
- **Expected result.** Pre-registered: **P1 wins in both arms**, i.e. H1
  supported and H2's null (the joker does not change the sign) supported. A P2
  win is the informative outcome and is reported as such, **not re-run**. No
  alternative deck, fill rule, or board size is run for H1/H2 unless registered
  in advance under H6 with its own ID.
- **Power caveat, recorded before the run.** Root-value agreement between the two
  arms is at most 1 bit of evidence against a 50% prior, and 8 of 9 cells on this
  board are boundary cells, so many ordinary placements flip nothing and act as
  joker substitutes. **H2 is not reported from root-value agreement alone**; it
  is reported from the criticality measure (fraction of solved positions whose
  value changes when P1's extra tile is swapped), which requires the database to
  be indexed by hand — a constraint on the solver, not an afterthought.
- **Artefacts.** `data/subgame-solutions/3x3-h1.json`,
  `data/subgame-solutions/3x3-h2.json`. Each header carries board size, the
  literal tile list of both hands, `ordering: internal | az-seeded` and
  `termination: exhausted | budget` (adr-004 R3), and the degree histogram of the
  board.

### EXP-002 — 5×3 exhaustive solve, both arms

- **Objective.** The exact game value of the 5×3 variant. This is the
  **strategically meaningful** exact solve and it carries the H1/H2 partial
  verdicts.
- **Supersedes the 4×4.** Per [adr-011](../docs/adr/adr-011-reduced-variant-parity.md)
  (Accepted 2026-08-05) the previously registered 4×4 target is withdrawn:
  16 cells is even, so draws are possible and no tie-break rule exists.
- **Hypothesis.** H1, H2.
- **Configuration.** 15 cells (5 columns × 3), odd. `a = 7`:
  - **H1 arm** — P1: `{P6, P3-y, P1, P2-adj, P2-skip, P2-opp, P3-fan}` + joker
    (8 tiles). P2: the same seven archetypes.
  - **H2 arm** — P1: those seven plus `P3-tri` (8 archetypes, no joker). P2: the
    same seven.

  Both arms: hands exactly exhausted at ply 15, P1 moves last, bound
  **1.751 × 10¹⁰**, terminal layer **32,768** (`--cells 15 --hands 8 7`).
  Identical state-space size. Automorphism group measured before the run with
  `scripts/check_symmetry.py 5 3` and recorded in the artefact — expected to be
  the same Z/2 mirror as the 5×5 (A↔E, B↔D, C fixed).
  Deterministic and exhaustive: no seed.
- **Decision rule.** As EXP-001, gates adr-010 **V0, V1, V2, V4, V5, V6**. V4's
  sample size and seed are recorded here before the run. Additionally a
  **principal-variation audit**: the value of every position on the optimal PV
  from the root, plus the root value under each distinct first move, is
  independently re-derived by direct forward search. V4 bounds the *rate* of
  errors in the database; only the PV audit targets the number actually
  reported.
- **If the run does not complete**, the honest report is the deepest layer fully
  resolved and the storage footprint reached — **not** a partial value. Note that
  a retrograde sweep resolves high `t` first, so a stall leaves the root
  untouched and the artefact carries *zero* information about H1/H2. A stalled
  run may not be presented as a trend.
- **Resource budget.** Peak co-resident working set is layers `t = 8` and `t = 9`
  of the profile; recorded with a disk figure and a fallback before the run
  starts.
- **Expected result.** Pre-registered: **P1 wins in both arms**. Recorded before
  the run so that a P2 win cannot be retrofitted into "as expected", and **not
  re-run** under a different configuration if it comes out the other way.
- **Artefacts.** `data/subgame-solutions/5x3-h1.json`,
  `data/subgame-solutions/5x3-h2.json`, headers as EXP-001.

### EXP-003 — endgame subtree cost: does searching beat storing?

- **Objective.** Find the crossover `k*` at which materialising an endgame
  database beats exact forward search, on the shipped 5×5. This decides
  [adr-012](../docs/adr/adr-012-endgame-database-storage.md) between Options A
  and B.
- **Hypothesis.** — (exploratory; it constrains H3's comparison set).
- **Configuration.** 25 cells, hands 13 + 12. For each `k = 3…8`: 200 positions
  sampled uniformly from legal play at ply `25 − k` (reached by random playout),
  solved exactly by alpha-beta, **with** and **without** a transposition table.
  Report node counts and wall time as distributions, not means. **Seed: 1.**
- **Decision rule, pre-declared.** If the **median** exact search at a given `k`
  costs under **10⁶ nodes**, no database is built for that `k`. `k*` is the
  smallest `k` whose median exceeds that. If `k* > 5`, adr-012 Option B is
  adopted and Phase 3 ships no endgame database — with the consequence, recorded
  in adr-012, that H3 loses its 5×5 endgame-layer comparison member.
- **Expected result.** Pre-registered: `k* ≥ 6`, i.e. the roadmap's `k ≤ 5` target
  is not worth materialising. Precedent: Othello was weakly solved at 36 empty
  squares with no endgame database at all (Takizawa 2023).

### EXP-004 — real compressibility of a solved layer

- **Objective.** Measure bits/position achievable on an actual FLIPHEX layer,
  rather than importing a ratio from checkers or Syzygy where the index is
  material-based and the don't-care set is locally decidable.
- **Hypothesis.** —
- **Status: blocked** on EXP-001 (needs a solved layer to compress).
- **Configuration.** Every layer of the solved 3×3, then of the 5×3. Four
  encodings: raw bit array, block-RLE, block-Zstd, logic-minimized. Each measured
  at a stated block size and reported with **probe latency**, not compression
  ratio alone — the objective is bytes-touched-per-probe, not ratio.
  Deterministic: no seed.
- **Decision rule.** Chooses between adr-012 Options A and C, and calibrates the
  largest `k` that fits available disk. No pre-declared threshold: this is a
  measurement, not a test.

### EXP-005 — don't-care yield and the V1 reachability gap

- **Objective.** Two things at once: the fraction of the closed-form bound that
  has **no legal predecessor** (the only don't-care source available, per
  adr-012 decision 7), and adr-010 **V1's** measurement of the gap between the
  bound and true reachability.
- **Hypothesis.** —
- **Enabled by** [adr-011](../docs/adr/adr-011-reduced-variant-parity.md) and
  [adr-012](../docs/adr/adr-012-endgame-database-storage.md) decision 7.
- **Configuration.** 5×3, 15 cells, hands 8 + 7. For each layer `t`, count
  configurations with no legal predecessor, one step back. Deterministic and
  exhaustive: no seed.
- **Decision rule.** If the yield is under **20%**, don't-cares are dropped from
  the adr-012 design entirely. **The reachability count is recorded before any
  don't-care filling** — filling destroys the distinction between "unreachable"
  and "computed", and it cannot be recovered afterwards.
- **Calibration note, pre-registered.** V1 is **not** a pass/fail gate as adr-010
  currently words it. The closed-form bound counts configurations consistent with
  the invariants, and a correct reachable-closure enumerator disagrees with it by
  a factor of **exactly 2 at layer `t = 1`** — the formula's `2^t` counts
  colourings the mover's colour forbids (at `t = 1` on the 3×3: formula
  `9 × 2 × 13 = 234`, reachable `9 × 13 = 117`). Before either solve is cited,
  adr-010 V1 must be restated as either (a) **exact per-layer equality** against
  the configuration space, in which case it is a genuine `perft` and any
  inequality voids the run, or (b) a **one-sided measurement**
  `count_enum ≤ count_formula`, in which case it is not a gate. This experiment
  supplies the calibration for (b).
